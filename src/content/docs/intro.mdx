E-commerce in Africa is still broken. There are a lot of online shops, but few have websites or better still mobile apps to showcase products and effortlessly receive orders.

Existing solutions are built for a western audience and do not provide mobile apps out of the box.

Nuanom is a powerful, but simple e-commerce platform. You don’t even need to type product names and descriptions. Just upload an image and let our AI generate names and descriptions for you.

You don’t need a designer or developer to setup an online shop with Nuanom. Nuanom takes care of you. Nuanom even takes care of your domain registration and renewal.

Nuanom allows you to run sales without lifting a finger. Receive 100s, 1000s or even millions of orders in your sleep.

Nuanom websites and mobile apps do not slow down or crash. We guarantee 99.999% uptime. 

Nuanom is frequently updated and improved. You get all new features and improvements at no extra cost.
