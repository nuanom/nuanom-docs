The Nuanom app is arguably the best MoMo POS. You can use Nuanom to take payments as well as issue invoices and receipts to your customers. It's super simple.

On the Orders tab, tap the 'Create' button. Use the 'Add products' button to add products to the order. If the customer has already made payment for the products you can toggle the 'Exclude Products' switch ON.

Now the secret is to leave out the delivery option. When delivery is left out Nuanom automatically knows you are creating a receipt or initiating an in-person order.

Orders without delivery and with excluded products are considered receipts so there is no payment to be made. The total will be GHS 0. The order moves straight into your order history. The customer receives an electronic receipt via SMS confirming the order.

Orders without delivery and with a payment option are considered in-person orders so the customer receives an electronic invoice via SMS they can use to initiate MoMo payment. The order stays in the POS section until the payment is made.

Yes, you can use Nuanom as a total POS replacement. In Ghana, most people don't use debit/credit cards so in most cases there is no need for bulky and expensive POS'. MoMo all the way.

Enjoy the magic!
