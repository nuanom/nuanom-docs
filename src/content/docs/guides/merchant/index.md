## Mobile & MoMo

Nuanom is heavily designed for Ghana where most people hardly check their emails. We use mobile numbers instead of emails for user authentication.
We send a one time password (OTP) via SMS making authentication very simple for users. SMS has proven to be insanely reliable for comms. We have tailored every part
of our platform for this.

This allows us to have a quick and high conversion checkout. We only accept mobile money (MoMo) payments.
