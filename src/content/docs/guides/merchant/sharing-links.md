Nuanom helps you take these orders like a champ. Customers typically reach out via DMs to make inquiries or purchases.

Your customers can easily order on your shop's website. Nuanom has the fastest checkout experience. Customers can pay instantly or on delivery with MoMo.

Sharing individual products is great for specific inquiries. However, you might want to share the link to your entire shop's storefront. This can be found on the Business tab. Tap the link under your shop's name to show similar sharing and preview options as seen on product listings.
